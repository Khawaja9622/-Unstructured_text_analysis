      "India's honouring of Abhinandan for 'imaginary feats of gallantry' against military norms: Pakistan 2021-11-23 11:10:43 Pakistan on Tuesday termed the gallantry award conferred on Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan Varthaman — who was captured by Pakistan in 2019 after his MiG 21 Bison aircraft was shot down by a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jet and later returned to India — a \"classic case of Indian fabrication and pure fantasy\" aimed at appeasing domestic audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement issued a day after Abhinandan was given the Vir Chakra medal by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, the Foreign Office said the move was done to \"hide [India's] embarrassment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Vir Chakra is India's third-highest wartime gallantry award after Param Vir Chakra and Maha Chakra.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a report by The Indian Express, Abhinandan, who was recently promoted from wing commander to group captain, was awarded the medal for \"showing conspicuous courage\" while shooting down a Pakistani F-16 aircraft in February 2019 — a claim that has been rubbished by the Pakistan military, independent observers as well as the international media.\n",

      "Read: India didn’t shoot down Pakistani F-16: US report\n",
      "\n",
      "The claim was refuted again by the Foreign Office in its statement today. \"Pakistan categorically rejects the entirely baseless Indian claims that a Pakistani F-16 aircraft was shot down by an Indian pilot before he was captured by Pakistan in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in February 2019,\" it read.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement noted that international experts as well as United States officials had already determined that no Pakistani F-16 aircraft was shot down on the day concerned after taking stock of the country's F-16 aircrafts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"India’s insistence on propagating a lie that has been thoroughly exposed is ludicrous and nonsensical. Granting military honours for imaginary feats of gallantry is contrary to every norm of military conduct. By giving such award, also as an afterthought, India has only made a mockery of itself,\" the statement added.\n",

The pilot who ejected from the aircraft in AJK — Abhinandan — was captured by Pakistan and later handed over as a goodwill gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Indian Air Force in a \"state of panic\" shot down its own Mi-17 helicopter on the same day which it denied initially but accepted later, the FO recalled.\n",

      "\"Indian Air Force was completely outplayed on the day. It is obvious that India's farcical story has no credibility whatsoever before the international community,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pakistan stands as ready and resolute to thwart any hostile designs as it was in February 2019. India would do well to learn a lesson from its botched attempt to violate Pakistan's sovereignty and refrain from any misadventure in future,\" the FO warned.\n",

      "A wide cross-section of the Pakistani citizenry had subsequently called for him to be treated with respect and dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Famously, a video released by the ISPR had shown the officer conversing with military officials in a congenial environment and acknowledging that he had been treated well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to put this on record; I will not change my statement even when I go back to my country. The officers of the Pakistan Army have looked after me very well,\" Abhinandan had acknowledged in the video.\n",

Leading the way, NDTV has learnt, was the US, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. There has been no official comment from the Indian government on these efforts. It was, however, clear that Washington had played a key role when President Donald Trump told the world media from Hanoi on Thursday morning that \"reasonably attractive news was coming from India and Pakistan\".\n",

      "He told journalists, who had gathered for his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, \"We've been involved in trying to have them stop and we have some reasonably decent news. I think, hopefully, that's going to be coming to an end. It has been going on for a long time\".\n",
