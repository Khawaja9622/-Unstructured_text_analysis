Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that the pilot, whose jet was downed during a dogfight between Pakistani and Indian warplanes, would be released Friday as a ""gesture for peace.""

Despite the planned release of the pilot, tensions in the region continued Thursday. Indian Army Major General Surinder Singh Bahal told a joint news conference of India's Army, Navy and Air Force in New Delhi on Thursday that India remains on ""high alert.""

Pakistan said four civilians were killed by Indian fire across the Line of Control, which separates Indian-controlled Kashmir from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. India's army accused Pakistan of initiating the exchange of fire on Thursday.

Khan's announcement came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that ""the entire country is ... standing with our soldiers"" after several days of military exchanges between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

The release of an Indian pilot by Pakistan would be a ""very much welcomed step"", spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres said Thursday, stressing that the message to India and Pakistan from the world body and the international community is to de-escalate tensions.

In a surprise announcement during a joint session of Parliament, Prime Minister Imran Khan said Thursday that captured Indian Air Force pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman will be released on Friday as a ""gesture of peace"".

Pakistan detained Wing Commander Varthaman Wednesday following a fierce engagement between air forces of the two sides along the Line of Control when his MiG 21 fighter jet was downed.

""The reports of the promise of the release of the Indian pilot by the Pakistani authorities would be a very much welcomed step,"" spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Stephane Dujarric told reporters.

""We would encourage both parties to do whatever they can to de-escalate the situation and this is the message that has been passed on by the UN and by the international community as a whole,"" he said.

Asked whether the Secretary General spoke with the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan amid the escalating tensions between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbors, Dujarric said ""contacts have been had with both sides at various levels"". He did not give further details.

Guterres has been following with ""deep concern"" the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, calling on both sides to urgently take steps to lower tensions through ""meaningful mutual engagement"".

The Secretary General is ""obviously, following the situation as we see it even today with deep concern, and the United Nations'' message, both publicly and privately, to both sides is to urgently take steps to lower tensions through meaningful, mutual engagement and meet their responsibilities to maintain peace and security in the region,"" Dujarric had said on Wednesday.

Guterres had received a call Tuesday from Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.

When asked if the Secretary General is planning to get involved to try and mediate a de-escalation, Dujarric had said ""as always"", the Secretary-General's offices are ""available should both parties or all parties, depending on the situation, agree to do that"".

The spokesperson said the UN chief, through his contacts and others, is in touch with the relevant parties to pass along the message of the need to take steps to lower tensions and exercise maximum restraint.

Dujarric said contacts have been made at various levels between the UN, India and Pakistan, but did not give further details as to which officials in India were contacted.

Asked about the UN's role at this point in the situation, he said that the Secretary-General is ""kept apprised"" of the situation and he is following it.

Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pulwama attack claimed by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Forty CRPF soldiers were killed in the suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir.

India carried out air strikes against the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot. In the operation, a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for suicide attacks were eliminated.

Pakistan on Wednesday claimed it shot down two Indian fighter jets over Pakistani air space and arrested a pilot."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking in Kanyakumari, took a dig at the UPA government, saying unlike India's response following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, India 'acted' this time.

""26/11 happened, India expected action against terrorists but nothing happened. Uri happened and you saw what our brave men did. Pulwama happened and you saw what our brave men did. I salute all those who are serving the nation. Their vigilance keeps our nation secure, PM Modi said.

Modi then went on to hit out at the opposition for 'politicising' the operations carried out by the armed forces.

""Sadly, a few parties, guided by Modi hatred have started hating India. No wonder, while the entire nation supports our armed forces, they suspect the armed forces. The world is supporting India’s fight against terror but a few parties suspect our fight against terror,"" he said."

PM holds high-level meeting after Imran Khan’s appeal for dialogue

An Indian pilot was captured by Pakistan after a major aerial confrontation and chase between Pakistan Air Force planes, which dropped bombs in four locations of Jammu and Kashmir, and Indian Air Force jets that countered them over the Line of Control (LoC).

The confrontation began after Pakistan sent several aircraft to the LoC on Wednesday morning in retaliation for the Indian Air Force strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Balakot a day earlier.

The government said IAF jets shot down an F-16 jet of the PAF in the skirmish, and the wreckage had fallen on the Pakistan side. Pakistan’s military, however, denied the loss of any aircraft.

The pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, began to chase the Pakistani jets and push them back, when he had to eject over the LoC after the MiG-21 he was flying was shot by a Pakistani plane and then landed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, where he was taken into custody.

In enemy hands

The MEA said it is awaiting details of Wg. Cdr. Varthaman’s arrest and condition through diplomatic and official channels, and demanded his “safe and immediate return”.

Manhandled by crowd

In various amateur videos, Wg. Cdr. Varthaman is seen being manhandled by a crowd in PoK.

In the evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting of the service chiefs, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other senior officials to take stock of the day’s developments and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s appeal for dialogue to de-escalate the situation.

“India strongly objected to Pakistan’s vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian Air Force in violation of all norms of International Humanitarian Law and the Geneva Convention. It was made clear that Pakistan would be well advised to ensure that no harm comes to the Indian defence personnel in its custody. India also expects his immediate and safe return,” the government said in its démarche.

Later, the Pakistan military released a video of Wg Cdr Varthaman drinking tea and speaking to Pakistani military personnel as proof that he had not been harmed.

PAF claims it didn't cross LoC

According to a release from the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, the PAF had carried out strikes without crossing the LoC at “non-military targets, avoiding human loss and collateral damage”, in words that mirrored the MEA statement on Tuesday.

Pakistan military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor also said that PAF aircraft in the operation had “locked into six targets” including supply depots in Bhimber gali, Rajouri and Nowshera in Jammu and Kashmir, and claimed they dropped bombs in open areas “at a safe distance” from four of them in an effort to “prove their capability and resolve” to retaliate if required.

Rejecting the Pakistani claims, the MEA said that Pakistan’s aerial response had in fact targeted military installations on the Indian side and “due to [IAF’s] high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.”

Terming the Pakistani operations an “unprovoked act of aggression”, the government said India reserves the right to “take firm and decisive action”, calling for the immediate return of the pilot.

India summons Pak Acting High Commissioner

India handed over its protest in a démarche to the Pakistan Acting High Commissioner Syed Haider Shah who was summoned by the Joint Secretary in the Ministry Deepak Mittal.

Referring to the Indian strikes on Balakot on Tuesday, the MEA said it had also handed over a dossier to Mr. Shah with “specific details of JeM complicity in the Pulwama terror attack and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan” and called on Pakistan to take immediate action against terrorism emanating from its territory.

With the possibility of escalation growing, several countries rushed in to appeal for restraint from New Delhi and Islamabad."

Rangers officials handed over the captured pilot to Indian officials at Wagah border crossing.

Officials of the Indian High Commission and Indian Air Attache Group Captain JT Krain, who reached Lahore with Abhinandan's travel documents, were also present at the time of handing over of captured Indian pilot. The Indian air attache also left with Abhinandan for India from the Wagah border crossing. ""Wing Commander Abhinandan, Indian POW, returned to India today, as committed by PM Khan in his address to joint sitting of parliament, yesterday,"" Foreign Office spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal tweeted. The Foreign Office of Pakistan said while in captivity, Abhinandan was treated ""with dignity and in line with international law"".

Wing Commander Abhinandan was captured when his MiG-21 among two Indian military aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force after they ventured into the Pakistani airspace.



The move to release the pilot was announced Thursday by Prime Minister Imran Khan at a joint session of Parliament, a day after Pakistan shot down two Indian aircraft that had crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and captured Wing Commander Abhinandan.



Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi earlier today confirmed Wing Commander Abhinandan would be handed back to Indian officials at the Wagah border crossing.



""As the prime minister has said, as a peace gesture and to de-escalate matters, the Indian pilot will be released. So today, this afternoon, he will be released at Wagah,"" Qureshi told a joint session of parliament Friday.

The Wagah crossing gate is famed for hosting an elaborate daily ceremony by Indian and Pakistani soldiers at sundown. Thousands of people had already gathered on the Indian side early Friday to welcome the pilot home, an AFP journalist said.

Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj earlier commented that ""India does not wish to see further escalation of the situation"". Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to make a public comment.



'De-escalation efforts should not be considered weakness'

PM Imran Khan, while addressing the joint session of Parliament, urged India not to escalate the situation as he announced to free the captured Indian pilot.

“Don’t take this any further, Pakistan will be forced to retaliate,"" he warned, noting that the de-escalation efforts made by Pakistan should not be considered as weakness.

""Despite us opening the Kartarpur corridor, we received no response from India,"" he said.

""When the Pulwama attack happened, we were blamed within 30 minutes,"" the premier lamented. ""I asked them to share evidence.""

""We did not want to inflict any casualty on India as we wanted to act in a responsible manner. […] I had said that if India does something then we will respond.""



PM receives praise for decision to release Indian pilot

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed PM Imran's decision to release the captured Indian fighter pilot, in what was seen as an effort to de-escalate the gravest crisis between the two countries in years.

""The report of the release of the Indian pilot by the Pakistani authorities would be very much a welcome step,"" UN chief's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, in response to a question at a regular briefing at the United Nations headquarters in New York.



Turkish President Erdogan

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated PM Imran on his statesman-like offer to India for de-escalating tensions and working towards peace.

Appreciating the announcement by the Pakistani premier to release the captured pilot, the Turkish president pointed out that this gesture was ""a sign of strength.""

Navjot Singh Sidhu



Indian cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu also hailed the move and called it a noble act.



""Imran Khan every noble act makes a way for itself…your goodwill gesture is ‘a cup of joy’ for a billion people, a nation rejoices…I am overjoyed for his parents and loved ones.”



Mirwaiz Umar Farooq

Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq hoped better sense would prevail after PM Imran's peace gesture.

He shot down an F-16 over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir during India's Balakot air strike but was taken captive by the Pakistan Army after his plane was shot down by enemy forces. Abhinandan was a Wing Commander back then.

HERE’S HOW IT HAPPENED

On February 14, Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed over 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama. Soon after the attack, the tension between India and Pakistan increased.

India, in retaliation, carried out a pre-dawn airstrike on a JeM terror camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A day later, 24 Pakistan Air Force jets entered the Indian airspace near the Line of Control (LoC) and dropped bombs in Indian territory.

Abhinandan Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, was captured on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison was hit by Pakistan’s fire across the Line of Control (LoC). Soon after Abhinandan was captured, Pakistan released footage of the Pakistan Army offering tea to him in an attempt to portray their courtesy towards him. But it was clear from his bloodied appearance that the treatment off the camera was far from that.

ABHINANDAN’S RELEASE

Two days after Abhinandan's capture, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that Abhinandan would be released as a ""peace gesture"".

During his release, Abhinandan held his head high and walked towards the Indian side of the Wagah-Attari border with a smile on his face. Abhinandan was accompanied by Pakistani rangers and the Indian air attache posted with the High Commission in Islamabad — who had gone to Lahore with travel documents.

Abhinandan is credited to have been the only Mig-21 pilot ever to have shot down an F-16.

Soon after his return, Abhinandan resumed duty and is now posted with the Air Force’s Frontline Unit in Rajasthan."

Abhinandan after India’s attack threat, claims PMLN leader",,"A Pakistani opposition leader has claimed that Indian Air Force pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was released after Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told a meeting of Pakistan’s top leaders that India would attack Pakistan.

Recalling the tension in Islamabad after India bombed a terror training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot on February 26, 2019 , Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Sardar Ayaz Sadiq criticised the Imran Khan government over its response, saying the Opposition has supported the government on every issue, including Kashmir and Wing Commander Varthaman, but it will no longer be appropriate to provide any further support, Dunya News reported on October 28.

Mr. Sadiq, who was the Speaker of the National Assembly during the PML-N government, made a similar statement earlier on October 28 in Parliament that Foreign Minister Qureshi in an important meeting pleaded that let Wing Commander Varthaman go back because India is attacking Pakistan.

The 37-year-old IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat.

In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan.

Abhinandan was returned to India from the Attari-Wagah border on March 1, 2019. He has been awarded the Vir Chakra on Independence Day by President Ram Nath Kovind for his exemplary bravery.

Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa (retired) has said Pakistan did not have a choice other than to release Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, days after his MiG-21 was downed in a dogfight in February last year. The Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot had also scored a kill, a Pakistani F-16, before his plane went down in Pakistan and he was captured.

The former IAF chief's comments came after a Pakistani politician in their national assembly revealed how Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was ""shaking and perspiring"" during a meeting to discuss Wing Commander Varthaman's capture.

A dogfight had broken out less than 24 hours after Indian jets bombed a camp of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan's Balakot, in response to Jaish's suicide attack on a convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama that left 40 soldiers dead.

""Me and Abhinandan's father go back a very long time. We did the flying instructor's course together... When Abhinandan got captured... my flight commander Ahuja in Kargil war, he got captured and was shot on the ground, so that was playing in my mind. I told him, 'Sir, I know we couldn't get Ahuja back, but we will definitely get Abhinandan back',"" Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa told news agency ANI. Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja, who flew a MiG-21, was killed by Pakistani forces after his fighter jet was shot down by Pakistani forces in 1999.

In a speech in the National Assembly, Pakistan Muslim League-N leader Ayaz Sadiq said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had in an important meeting said if Pakistan did not release Wing Commander Varthaman, India would attack Pakistan ""that night by 9 pm."" ""I remember Shah Mahmood Qureshi was in the meeting in which (Prime Minister) Imran Khan had refused to attend and Chief of Army Staff General Bajwa came into the room, his legs were shaking and he was perspiring. Foreign Minister said for god's sake let Abhinandan go, India's about to attack Pakistan at 9 pm,"" Mr Sadiq recounted the events of the meeting.

Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said Pakistan knew India's capability and that could have acted as deterrence against any harm coming to Wing Commander Varthaman.

""There are two parts to it. The main pressure on Pakistan was diplomatic and political. But there was also a military posture, the way he (Mr Sadiq) is saying that 'his legs (General Bajwa) were shaking and all', it is because the military posture was very offensive of all the three services, Army, Navy, Air Force,"" the former IAF chief said.

""And God forbid had they hit our installations on February 27, we were also in a position to wipe out their forward brigades. They know our capability. Basically, if this thing is there in their mind that we are likely to strike, they first look at how their own military is doing. The American President Theodore Roosevelt used to say, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick'. So the big stick was the military,"" Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said.

The former Air Chief Marshal served in a MiG-21 squadron with Wing Commander Varthaman's father, who retired as an Air Marshal.

After healing from injuries, Wing Commander Varthaman returned to the cockpit in less than six months since he returned home from captivity."

Highlights Mike Pompeo spoke to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval: Reports

Another key player was UAE, an an important ally for India

Saudi Arabia spoke about helping to de-escalate tensions

India sighed with relief when Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman would be sent home on Friday as a ""peace gesture"" -- a move that came with immense international pressure to pull both countries back from the brink. Leading the way, NDTV has learnt, was the US, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. There has been no official comment from the Indian government on these efforts. It was, however, clear that Washington had played a key role when President Donald Trump told the world media from Hanoi on Thursday morning that ""reasonably attractive news was coming from India and Pakistan"".

He told journalists, who had gathered for his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, ""We've been involved in trying to have them stop and we have some reasonably decent news. I think, hopefully, that's going to be coming to an end. It has been going on for a long time"".

There are reports the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, spoke to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval for 25 minutes this morning.

Another key player was the UAE, which has become an important ally for India.

The Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, tweeted on Thursday evening that he had made ""telephone calls to the Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers"", stressing the ""importance of dealing wisely with recent developments and giving priority to dialogue and communication"".

Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj is addressing an OIC (Organisation of Islamic Conference) meeting in Abu Dhabi today -- a first for India, which has been invited as a Guest of Honour at the plenary.

This is significant, given the OIC has taken Pakistan's side on Kashmir for years, and Pakistan's Foreign Minister was so miffed, he had threatened not to attend if India was there.

The third player was Saudi Arabia, which has publicly spoken about helping to de-escalate tensions after the Pulwama attack.

Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign affairs, Adel al Jubeir, will fly to Islamabad Friday with an ""important message from the Crown Prince, MBS"". Coincidentally, the Saudi envoy to India met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday as well.

Other countries like the UK, France and Russia -- all permanent members of the UN security Council -- had also been calling for restraint. As has China.

In the end, Pakistan would have had to release Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman under the Geneva Convention. But the fact that they did it so quickly can be attributed to the immense pressure from India and other nations to avoid an escalation of the situation."
