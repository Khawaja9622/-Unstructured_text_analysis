In a statement issued a day after Abhinandan was given the Vir Chakra medal by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, the Foreign Office said the move was done to ""hide [India's] embarrassment"".

Vir Chakra is India's third-highest wartime gallantry award after Param Vir Chakra and Maha Chakra.

According to a report by The Indian Express, Abhinandan, who was recently promoted from wing commander to group captain, was awarded the medal for ""showing conspicuous courage"" while shooting down a Pakistani F-16 aircraft in February 2019 — a claim that has been rubbished by the Pakistan military, independent observers as well as the international media.

The claim was refuted again by the Foreign Office in its statement today. ""Pakistan categorically rejects the entirely baseless Indian claims that a Pakistani F-16 aircraft was shot down by an Indian pilot before he was captured by Pakistan in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in February 2019,"" it read.

The statement noted that international experts as well as United States officials had already determined that no Pakistani F-16 aircraft was shot down on the day concerned after taking stock of the country's F-16 aircrafts.

""India’s insistence on propagating a lie that has been thoroughly exposed is ludicrous and nonsensical. Granting military honours for imaginary feats of gallantry is contrary to every norm of military conduct. By giving such award, also as an afterthought, India has only made a mockery of itself,"" the statement added.

Timeline: Events leading up to the Feb 2019 Pak-India aerial combat

Recalling the events of Feb 27, 2019, the FO said two Indian aircraft were shot down — a MiG 21 Bison aircraft that fell down in AJK and a SU 30 aircraft that fell on the other side of the Line of Control (LoC). The pilot who ejected from the aircraft in AJK — Abhinandan — was captured by Pakistan and later handed over as a goodwill gesture.

In addition, the Indian Air Force in a ""state of panic"" shot down its own Mi-17 helicopter on the same day which it denied initially but accepted later, the FO recalled.

""Indian Air Force was completely outplayed on the day. It is obvious that India's farcical story has no credibility whatsoever before the international community,"" the statement said.

""Pakistan stands as ready and resolute to thwart any hostile designs as it was in February 2019. India would do well to learn a lesson from its botched attempt to violate Pakistan's sovereignty and refrain from any misadventure in future,"" the FO warned.

Abhinandan's capture and release

Following an attack in occupied Kashmir's Pulwama earlier that month, Indian military planes violated the LoC on Feb 26, 2019, intruding from the Muzaffarabad sector.

""Pakistan Air Force immediately scrambled"" and Indian aircraft went back, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said at the time.

The next day the PAF undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.

""In response to PAF strikes this morning [...] Indian Air Force crossed the LoC. PAF shot down two Indian aircraft inside Pakistani airspace. One of the aircraft fell inside Azad Jammu and Kashmir while the other fell inside IOK,"" said ISPR.

""One Indian pilot (Abhinandan) arrested by troops on ground while two in the area,"" it added.

Abhinandan was initially captured by locals in Azad Kashmir before being taken into custody by Pakistan Army personnel. Videos of his capture showed army soldiers and officers intervening forcefully to save him from a crowd of angry citizens.

A wide cross-section of the Pakistani citizenry had subsequently called for him to be treated with respect and dignity.

Famously, a video released by the ISPR had shown the officer conversing with military officials in a congenial environment and acknowledging that he had been treated well.

""I'd like to put this on record; I will not change my statement even when I go back to my country. The officers of the Pakistan Army have looked after me very well,"" Abhinandan had acknowledged in the video.

He was later handed over in a gesture of peace to India at the Wagah border on March 1, 2019."

Speaking to Pakistani lawmakers in parliament, Khan said the pilot, identified as Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, would be released on Friday. Khan also said that he tried to reach out to his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, to de-escalate tensions between the two countries.

""Pakistan wants peace, but it should not be treated as our weakness,"" Khan said. ""The region will prosper if there is peace and stability. It is good for both sides.""

Khan's comments came after Modi said that ""India's enemies are conspiring to create instability in the country through terror attacks.""

High tensions in South Asia

India welcomed Pakistan's decision to free the captured pilot but said it remained on a ""heightened"" state of alert.

""We are fully prepared and in a heightened state of readiness to respond to any provocation from Pakistan,"" said the Indian Army's Major General Surendra Singh Mahal at a press conference. He said ground-based air defense weapons had been ""put on high alert"" along the Line of Control that divides disputed Kashmir between the two nuclear-armed rivals.

Top Indian military officials also renewed claims that it had shot down a Pakistani F-16 jet on Wednesday and flashed fragments from a missile carried on the alleged warplane. Pakistan has denied India's claims.

Nandan's plane was one of two Indian planes shot down by Pakistan on Wednesday. Nandan's plane crashed in the Pakistan-held part of Kashmir and the other crashed in the Indian-controlled part of the region. Pakistan later aired a video of Nandan being captured and taken into custody.

Tensions between the two South Asian neighbors have escalated since a suicide bombing by a Pakistan-based terror group killed over 40 Indian paramilitary troops in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.

On Tuesday, India responded with a pre-dawn airstrike inside Pakistan. It was the first such raid since both countries went to war in 1971.

In newly-released footage, obtained by Dawn.com, Abhinandan noted that he saw no differences between the landscape and people of Pakistan and India when he was descending in his parachute after his plane had been shot down. The footage appears to be from the same interview, a part of which was aired after his capture two years ago.

""I could not find any difference between the two countries from above. Both are equally beautiful and when I [descended], I did not even know whether I was in Pakistan or my own country, India because both countries looked the same to me. All the people, everything looked the same to me.""

Recounting what happened on the day of his capture, Abhinandan said that he had been injured ""quite badly and was unable to move"". When it seemed to me that I was not in my own country, I tried to run away, he continued.

He revealed that Pakistani citizens whose ""passion was quite high"" wanted to catch the Indian pilot. However, two soldiers of the Pakistan Army reached his location, took hold of him and ""saved me"".

""A captain of the Pakistani Army came, he saved me from these people. He took me to his unit where I was given first aid and after that I was taken to the hospital where I was checked and given more aid. Since then, I am here [at the place] I am right now [...] with your hospitality,"" he continued.

Abhinandan then moved on to Kashmir, saying ""neither you nor I know"" what is happening in the occupied territory.

The Indian official praised the Pakistan Army, saying he found it to be ""a very fine, professional force and very chivalrous"".

""I am very impressed by the chivalry which has been displayed by the Pakistani Army,"" he added.

Abhinandan also expressed the hope that peace could be established between the two neighbours. ""I do not know what needs to be done to bring about peace but I only know that there should be peace. And I see no reason for us to continue with any kind of hostilities. I want that peace [should] be established.

""We can live in peace,"" he emphasised.
